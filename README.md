# Computer_Networks

These are the assignments I did under my CSE202: Computer Networks Course

The assignments were big enough to be considered as a full fledged project. This is a short summary:
Developed TCP socket servers in C/C++ utilizing I/O multiplexing techniques (select, poll, epoll) to benchmark synchronous
and asynchronous server performance on Linux.
